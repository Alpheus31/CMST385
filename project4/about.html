        <h1>About</h1>
       <p>Sin Eater Comics is a story that started out as a joke among friends. <br>
          Two friends were chatting about the roman legions and how things worked with them. <br> 
        At one point, the act of eating another person's sins was added to the conversation. <br>
        People who are able to do this are called Sin Eaters. After that all it took was to <br>
        add the details.
