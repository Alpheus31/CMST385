        <p1>Led Zeppelin is an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of vocalist Robert Plant, 
        guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. 
        With a heavy, guitar-driven sound, they are cited as one of the progenitors of hard rock 
        and heavy metal, although their style drew from a variety of influences, including blues 
        and folk music. Led Zeppelin have been credited as significantly impacting the nature of 
        the music industry, particularly in the development of album-oriented rock (AOR) and
        stadium rock. Many critics consider Led Zeppelin one of the most innovative and 
        influential rock groups in history. </p1>
